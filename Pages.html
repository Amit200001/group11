                <p><h1>Astronaut Stars</h1> 
                    Commander Rayna Hale floated in silence, gazing at the endless sea of stars beyond her ship’s window. She was the sole occupant of the Odyssey, humanity’s first solo deep-space mission beyond Mars. Earth was millions of kilometers away—a fading memory of green landscapes and familiar voices.
                The mission was simple: travel to Europa, scan for microbial life, return. But things never stay simple in space. A micrometeoroid storm had damaged communications, and now she floated in silence, cut off from Mission Control. Supplies were stable, and the ship remained functional, but isolation pressed in like gravity.
                She spoke to herself, sometimes aloud, sometimes in her head. “This is Hale. Day 147. Still breathing. Still watching.” Her voice echoed in the cabin like a ghost.
                Then, a signal blinked on her console. Not from Earth.
                Rayna’s pulse quickened. She stabilized the ship and replayed the signal. Rhythmic. Deliberate. Not random noise.
                Someone—or something—was out there.
                Alone no more, she stared into the black unknown, torn between fear and wonder. She reached for the comms switch, voice trembling with hope.
                “This is Commander Rayna Hale of the Odyssey. Identify yourself.”
                Silence returned.
                But now, it felt different. </p>

                <p> <h1>Save Trees and Plant</h1>
                    Trees are the lifelines of our planet. They provide us with oxygen, absorb harmful carbon dioxide, prevent soil erosion, support wildlife, 
                    and maintain the natural balance of ecosystems. Without trees, life on Earth would not be possible. However,deforestation and rapid urbanization 
                    have caused a significant decline in tree cover, leading to climate change, air pollution, and the loss of biodiversity.Saving existing trees is 
                    as important as planting new ones. Every tree takes years to grow and contributes immensely to the environment.By protecting forests, banning illegal 
                    logging, and practicing sustainable development, we can preserve nature’s green guardians. Individuals can also make a difference by avoiding paper waste, 
                    supporting tree-planting initiatives, and educating others about the importance of trees.Planting trees is an investment in the future. A single tree can support dozens of species, improve air quality, and provide shade and shelter. Schools, communities,
                    and governments should come together to organize tree-planting drives and promote green urban spaces. </p>

                <p> <h1>Earth on Fire</h1>
                    The image speaks louder than words—a planet suffocating under the weight of industrial greed. Towering smokestacks belch fire and black smoke into a darkened sky, 
                    as if trying to burn the Earth from within. Behind them, the planet looms large, its blue and green beauty marred by pollution and flames. Once symbols of progress, 
                    these factories now stand as monuments to destruction. The land below is scorched, rivers reflect the fire, and storms crackle in the distance, hinting at a climate 
                    spiraling out of control. This is not science fiction—it’s a warning. Human activity, especially deforestation, fossil fuel burning, and unchecked industrial growth,
                     is driving climate change to catastrophic levels. The air we breathe, the water we drink, and the forests that sustain us are being sacrificed for profit and convenience. 
                     If this continues, Earth may no longer be a cradle of life but a furnace of regret. It is not too late to act—but time is running out. We must reduce emissions, protect forests, 
                     shift to renewable energy, and reimagine our relationship with nature. Our future depends not on what we have done, but what we choose to do next. </p>
